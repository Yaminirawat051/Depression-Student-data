Depression Student Data
Depression Student Dataset with the help of Linear Regression,Perform EDA and Seaborn
Depression Student Dataset, which contains information on students' characteristics and their depression levels. The dataset may include features such as age, gender, study hours, family background, and social interactions, while the target variable could be a depression score or an indication of depression

Import Libraries:

Seaborn: For visualization, as it integrates with pandas and provides easy-to-use plotting functions.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Scikit-learn: To apply linear regression and fit models.

Load the Dataset:

Using pandas.read_csv() to load the dataset from a CSV file or any other source.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the relationship between variables and identify patterns.
Seaborn can be used to create various plots such as:
Pairplots: To visualize pairwise relationships.
Correlation Heatmap: To show correlation between features.
Boxplot/Violin plot: For distribution visualization of depression scores.

Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables (via encoding).
Normalize numerical features if necessary.
Linear Regression Model:

Linear Regression is used to predict a continuous depression score or assess the relationship between depression levels and features.
Split the data into training and test sets (using train_test_split).
Fit a linear regression model using LinearRegression() from Scikit-learn.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess model performance.
Use Seaborn to visualize the regression line or residuals.

Demonstrates the steps of loading a dataset, performing EDA, fitting a linear regression model, and evaluating its performance with the help of Seaborn for visualization.
